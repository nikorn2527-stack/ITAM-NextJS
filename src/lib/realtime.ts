/**
 * realtime.ts — in-process pub/sub for Server-Sent Events (SSE).
 *
 * Why this exists:
 *   • GAS uses client-side polling (60s intervals) — high latency + wasteful.
 *   • Next.js can keep a long-lived SSE connection open and push events to all
 *     connected clients the instant data changes. This module is the bridge:
 *     mutation endpoints call `publishRealtimeEvent()`; the `/api/itam/events`
 *     SSE route subscribes to a per-token channel and forwards events to the
 *     client over the wire.
 *
 * Cross-process note: this is in-memory, so it works when the whole app runs
 * in a single Node process (true for our standalone Next.js server). For
 * multi-instance deployments you'd swap the in-memory Map for Redis pub/sub.
 *
 * Server-only — do not import from client components.
